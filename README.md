🌐 My Portfolio Website
This is a simple portfolio website I created using HTML and CSS. It has two pages: a Home page and a Contact page. I made this project to practice basic web development and to start building my online presence.

🔧 What I Used
HTML for the structure

CSS for styling

📄 Pages
Home – A short introduction and overview

Contact – Ways to contact me like email or social links

This is one of my first projects and I'm excited to keep learning and improving it over time!

Thank you for wisiting my Portfolio website
